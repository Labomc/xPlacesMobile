<p>The 3 sound buttons play their sounds every time they are clicked 
      and are independent of the other buttons.
      The Chord button attemps to play 3 files at the same time.
      All the other buttons work together and independently of the Sound and Chord
      buttons.  Exception: 
      The volume buttons also apply to the Sound and Chord..
      The "Last Audio Player" value gives the audio player used for the last Sound or Chord
      played.  Values range from 1 to 9.  Chord requires 3 audio players as three distinct
      files are played.

    The hum files used in Chord were furnished by Alison Kotin.  Thanks.
