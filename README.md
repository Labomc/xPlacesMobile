xPlacesMobile
=============

xPlaces 2.0 is the evolution of xPlaces and it is focused on mobile devices and web support. It is based on a much more modern software architecture, than the previous version, built on top of Node.js and uses plenty of features of HTML5 such as WebSocket and access to various mobile sensor (accelerometer, gyroscope, geolocation and so forth).   But the major enhancement of the new version is that is backward compatible with an existing xPlaces network. Your can run a new mobile service that speaks flawlessly with an existing C++ based network.   The developper is now able to test and deploy an application that runs directly on mobile devices with or without the need to install any app on it, just pointing the mobile browser to a page and thatâ€™s it.
