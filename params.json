It is based on a much more modern software architecture, than the previous version, built on top of Node.js and uses plenty of features of HTML5 such as WebSocket and access to various mobile sensor (accelerometer, gyroscope, geolocation and so forth).   But the major enhancement of the new version is that is backward compatible with an existing xPlaces network. Your can run a new mobile service that speaks flawlessly with an existing C++ based network.   The developper is now able to test and deploy an application that runs directly on mobile devices with or without the need to install any app on it, just pointing the mobile browser to a page and thatâ€™s it. \r\n\r\n# Files and folders structure:\r\n\r\n  * node_modules\r\n  * examples\r\n  * misc\r\n  * JSON\r\n\r\n***\r\n## __node_modules__ \r\ncontains the whole library files.\r\n## __examples__ \r\ncontains stuff that use this library so you can see a real world example.\r\n##__JSON__ \r\ncontains all configuration and data files needed by both library and examples. \r\nYou can write your own configuration file and save it here.
